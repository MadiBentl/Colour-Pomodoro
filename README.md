# Colour-Pomodoro
The Pomodoro Technique is a highly effective time management method. It seperates a user's time into 25 minute periods of work alternating with 5 minute breaks. It was named after the Italian word for tomato and refers to the simple tomato-shaped kitchen timers that are popular across the world.

This version of the pomodoro technique allows users to enter custom times for both work and breaks. When a work or break period ends a buzzer sounds and the background colour changes from blue to orange or orange to blue, giving the user a visual cue that a work or break period has ended. The timer then automatically resets so that the user does not need to interact unnecessarily with the app.
